## Edge Cases

1. __Empty Inputs__: The input-form uses Angular Material form fields with required attributes, ensuring that the form cannot be submitted with empty fields.
2. __Duplicate Entries__: The aggregateData method in the display component combines workouts for the same user, updating the workout count and total minutes.
3. __Case Sensitivity__: The getFilteredData method converts the user name to lowercase, ensuring case-insensitive search.
4. __Invalid Data Types__: The form ensures workout minutes are a number using the number type input.
